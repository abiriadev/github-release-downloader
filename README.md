# GitHub Release Downloader

1. Browser tends to download files into system default
   download directory, not a current working directory of my
   terminal.
2. Releases are often too large (more than a Gigabyte) to
   download by browser. It can be handled by parallel
   downloaders like Axel.
3. It works without GUI environment.
